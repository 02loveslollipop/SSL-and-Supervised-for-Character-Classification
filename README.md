# Comparative Analysis of Self-Supervised and Supervised Pretraining Approaches for Genshin Impact Character Classification Using ResNet-18

## Overview
This repository contains a comparative analysis of self-supervised learning (SSL) and supervised learning (SL) approaches for character classification in Genshin Impact using the ResNet-18 architecture. The project explores the effectiveness of SSL methods, particularly SimCLR, in improving classification performance compared to traditional SL methods on a restricted labeled dataset of 9600 images.
